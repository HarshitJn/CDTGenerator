#1. Use CGAL::Linear_cell_complex as PLC. Add required functions e.g. locate() to get handle to the point in LCC nearest to the query point.

#2. Use CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_3

#3. Input should allow for more file options than ply.

#4. If time available, see why g++ -lgmp -lCGAL rply.cpp cdtCode.cpp does not link whereas, g++ rply.cpp cdtCode.cpp -lgmp -lCGAL does?
