#1. Use CGAL::Linear_cell_complex as PLC.

##2. Input should allow for more file options than ply.

#3. If time available, see why g++ -lgmp -lCGAL rply.cpp cdtCode.cpp does not link whereas, g++ rply.cpp cdtCode.cpp -lgmp -lCGAL does? Also there is issue in example usage of -l option given in 'man gcc' :(

#4. Replace naive code for finding all possible pairs of segments.

#5. Function for writing output mesh back in PLY format.

#6. Use finite_edges_iterator for computing missingSegmentsQueue

#7. Is there any better way to list all possible combinations(say to be able to do it in a for loop)?

#8. Replace missingSegment computation using 'is_edge()' function to search for plcSegments missing from DT

#9. How to remove hardcoded seeds for CGAL random number generator?
