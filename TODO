#1. Use CGAL::Linear_cell_complex as PLC.

##2. Input should allow for more file options than ply.

#3. If time available, see why g++ -lgmp -lCGAL rply.cpp cdtCode.cpp does not link whereas, g++ rply.cpp cdtCode.cpp -lgmp -lCGAL does? Also there is issue in example usage of -l option given in 'man gcc' :(

#4. Replace naive code for finding all possible pairs of segments.

#5. Use finite_edges_iterator for computing missingSegmentsQueue

#6. Is there any better way to list all possible combinations(say to be able to do it in a for loop)?

#7. How to remove hardcoded seeds for CGAL random number generator?

#8. Add termination criteria using local feature size for each vertex.

#9. Add algo. visualization for debugging using PCL. Maybe it can be later extended to interactive visualization where input can be given interactively.

#10. Represent plcVertices, plcFaces, plcSegments as unordered sets.
