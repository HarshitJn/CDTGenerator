# CDTGenerator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pranavkantgaur/CodedPhaseShift3DScanner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pranavkantgaur/CodedPhaseShift3DScanner)
Implementation of the paper "Meshing piecewise linear complex using CDT" by Hang Si et. al.

# Building
The code is under testing right now but one can get fair idea of overall steps involved in implementation of Hang Si's Constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization(CDT) algorithm.

# Extension
Main objective is to extend this implementation to support adaptive Constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization for 3D domain.
