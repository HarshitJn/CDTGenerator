#1. Use CGAL::Linear_cell_complex as PLC. Add required functions e.g. locate() to get handle to the point in LCC nearest to the query point.

#2. Input should allow for more file options than ply.

#3. If time available, see why g++ -lgmp -lCGAL rply.cpp cdtCode.cpp does not link whereas, g++ rply.cpp cdtCode.cpp -lgmp -lCGAL does? Also there is issue in example usage of -l option given in 'man gcc' :(

#4. Replace naive code for finding all possible pairs of segments.

#5. Add Point_3 of type float in CGAL.

#6. Function for writing output mesh back in PLY format.

#7. Use finite_edges_iterator for computing missingSegmentsQueue

#8. Is there any better way to list all possible combinations(say to be able to do it in a for loop)?

#9. Initialize info() of cells in LCC after it is imported from DT.

#10. Replace missingSegment computation using 'is_edge()' function to search for plcSegments missing from DT
